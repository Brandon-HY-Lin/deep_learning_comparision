# MNIST: Batch Normalization  (DNN with 3 Hidden layer)

Test accuracy with and without batch normalization (Each points represents 100 epochs)
![N|Solid](https://github.com/Brandon-HY-Lin/deep_learning_comparision/blob/master/datasets/MNINST/dnn_3_hidden_layers_with_batch_normalization/batch_normalization_fig_1a.png?raw=true)

This work is a reproduced work of Ioffe and Szegedy's paper [Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). This code only implements figure 1(a).

Some part of the code is modified from
* [R2RT's batch normalization tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.1/get_started/mnist/beginner://r2rt.com/implementing-batch-normalization-in-tensorflow.html)

# Accuracy: 0.98
# Statistics
* 3 Hidden layer with sigmoid activation function each
* Each hidden layer has 100 activation neurons
* Using GradientDescentOptimizer with learning rate=0.5
* 50k epochs
* Run time: 9min 39sec for batch normalization case
